A partnership with Qeld is your ideal opportunity to be rewarded for helping other businesses (and your customers). The concept is simple: do you know any entrepreneurs in need of a business loan? Refer them to Qeld and encourage them to submit a non-binding and free loan application. If Qeld makes them an offer and they accept, you - as the referral partner - are rewarded by a commission. This means that you can help other businesses find quick financing to purchase your products and services, expanding your customer base and reach whilst getting rewarded in the process.
