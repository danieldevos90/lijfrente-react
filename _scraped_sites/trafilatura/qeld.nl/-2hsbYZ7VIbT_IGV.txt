Qeld does not work with a startup fee for our business loans. Instead, you only pay a standard monthly service cost and a fixed amortisation for the duration of the loan term itself. Why should we charge you for choosing us? To us, start-up fees or costs don’t make any sense, which is exactly why we don’t work with them at all.

We don’t charge you to start a loan, neither do we charge you when you want to pay back the loan in full. At Qeld you have full flexibility to repay the outstanding loan sum at any time during your contract, meaning there is no lock-in period or penalty if you want to pay back in full.

No fees at the start, no fees at the end: at Qeld you only pay for the period you actually use the loan: smart.
