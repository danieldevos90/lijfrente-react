Qeld offers flexible business loans of up to €500,000 for transport and logistics companies to invest in vehicles, technology and maintenance. Our loans are quick and easy to apply for, with no start-up costs and fixed monthly costs. This gives you the financial space to grow your business and serve customers better.

The transport and logistics sector is the backbone of the economy, with companies moving goods from A to B on a daily basis to meet customer requirements. For entrepreneurs in this sector, investments are essential, not only in vehicles, but also in technology and personnel to keep up with growing demand. At Qeld, we understand the challenges and needs of entrepreneurs in the transport and logistics sector, which is why we offer flexible business loans up to €500,000 to support and grow your business.

For transport companies, a reliable fleet is essential to meet customer expectations and deliver on time. Whether you need to purchase new trucks, vans or other vehicles, maintaining a large fleet often requires considerable financial resources. With a Qeld business loan, you can expand your fleet or maintain and replace existing vehicles when necessary. This way, you can keep your business operational and take on new contracts without having to wait for slow banking procedures.

In the logistics sector, efficiency is the key to success. Investing in logistics software and technology can help you automate processes, saving both time and costs. With a Qeld business loan, you can implement systems such as GPS tracking systems, inventory management and route optimization software. By investing in technology, you not only improve the service for your customers, but you also increase internal efficiency, leading to better profitability for your logistics company.

Many transport companies face seasonal fluctuations in demand. Think of peak periods around the holidays or quiet summer months. Maintaining a stable cash flow is essential to be able to operate without worries during these periods. With a Qeld business loan, you have extra financial space to cover season-related expenses, such as hiring temporary workers or adapting your fleet for higher volumes. This way, you can prevent your company from getting into trouble during busy or quiet periods.

For companies in the transport sector, it is important to always keep vehicles and equipment in top condition. Regular maintenance prevents unexpected repairs and downtime, which can lead to costly delays. With a loan from Qeld, you can finance the necessary investments in maintenance and repairs without affecting your reserves. By proactively investing in the maintenance of your means of transport, you can increase the efficiency of your company and avoid unexpected costs.

Many entrepreneurs in the transport and logistics sector would like to grow their business, for example by adding new routes or serving new markets. A loan from Qeld can help you take this step. Invest in new vehicles, staff, or warehouse space so you're ready to expand your services. Thanks to our flexible loan, you can grow in a way that suits your business, without being bound by strict terms and conditions or long-term obligations.

At Qeld, we understand that entrepreneurs in the transport and logistics sector need flexibility and speed. Our loans are easy and quick to apply for, with no start-up costs or hidden costs. You can submit an online request within one minute, and in many cases, you will receive a response within an hour. If everything is in order, the money can be in your account the same day. Our loans have no mandatory term and work with a fixed monthly price, so you always know exactly where you stand.

With a Qeld business loan, you get the financial space to grow your transport or logistics company and better serve your customers. Apply for a loan today and find out how Qeld can support your business in the Dutch market
