Business loans for start-ups and new businesses have traditionally been difficult to obtain. Since 2015, our main goal has been to help as many small start-ups as possible with the right type of financing.

So it doesn't matter if you have a new or old company. Small is bigger doesn't matter either. So forget about your years of history, balance sheets and profit and loss statements and complicated business plans that the bank wants to see. At Qeld, we care about you and your plans for the future.

We offer business loans to all types of companies. Here's how a loan through Qeld works:

- Request takes 1 minute
- You will receive an answer within 1 hour
- The money will be paid out the same day


The loan has...

- No start-up costs
- No commitment period
- No hidden costs

**Welcome to apply!**

It is difficult for starting entrepreneurs to get a loan from a traditional bank because of the higher risks and limited amounts. At Qeld, however, we offer business loans for start-ups with no start-up costs, mandatory maturity or hidden costs, so that entrepreneurs have quick access to finance. Simply request in one minute and receive an answer within one hour, with payment the same day.

Maybe you're thinking about starting a business? Or maybe you've just started a new company? Unfortunately, borrowing money from the bank for a starting company is not easy. First, the risk is greatest in the beginning, before the company is well and truly up and running, and secondly, the amounts are rather small. The bank likes low risks and lends large amounts of money to large companies. It's just not worth spending time on startup companies for the bank.

A start-up is a company that has not yet established a company or has not filed its first financial statements. Some banks even require three accounts so as not to consider a company as a starter. At Qeld, we think this is wrong because a company's first three years are the hardest. Then you may need temporary capital injections to grow.

Before you get a business loan requests, you must have done your homework. What will your company do, how much money do you need to get started? How much can you repay per month? Think about this carefully so that you request the correct amount and can clearly explain how to repay the loan.

- Traditional bank loans are best suited if the company is a bit further along and there is an established cash flow.
- Qeld business loans are suitable if you have a temporary need for liquidity. Qeld is one of the few providers of loans to start-ups.
- Equity is appropriate if there is a high potential for the company to increase in value if it succeeds, but there is a high risk that it will take longer than planned.

At Qeld, we don't work with standard rates, because no company is the same. That's why we always give you a **personal offer**. This offer is a **fixed monthly price** which consists of two parts:** usage costs** and **installment**. This way, you know exactly what the loan costs you each month in advance.

All entrepreneurs, large and small, can apply for a business loan from Qeld. The only conditions we set are that the company is already registered with the Chamber of Commerce and that the owner resides in the Netherlands. Find out how much you can borrow now and submit your application!

You can use our business loan for all business purposes! Van **working capital** and **stockpile** upto **new equipment**, **company cars**, **machines** and more. We support all investments in your future. Get a business loan of €5,000 to €500,000. No start-up costs or fixed duration.

As a starting entrepreneur, you can apply for a business loan from Qeld, part of Qred Bank, from €5,000 to a maximum of €500,000. The exact loan you can receive depends on your business plan, financial situation, turnover and growth potential. At Qeld, we understand that starting entrepreneurs need fast and flexible financing without long-term obligations so that they can realize their business ideas.

With our simple application process, as a starter, you can submit an application within a few minutes and, once approved, the amount will be in your account within 24 hours. This makes it possible to invest directly in, for example, inventory, marketing, new machines, materials or staff, which can be essential for the success of your new company.
