Starting a construction project, setting up a sustainable initiative or getting an infrastructure project off the ground? Then you need extra working capital in the short term, so that you can switch quickly and take immediate steps. Traditional project financing is often slow, complex and comes with mountains of paperwork. At Qeld, business lending for project financing works differently: you quickly get clarity about your borrowing options and, if you agree to our offer, we will transfer the credit to you within 24 hours. So you can move on without wasting valuable time.

Many entrepreneurs face the same challenges:

- Long waiting time for approval of the funding application
- Uncertainty about total costs (variable interest rates, hidden costs)
- Complicated application procedures with a lot of paperwork
- Lack of flexibility when it comes to repayment
- Difficulty getting pre-financing for start-up or seasonal projects

At Qeld, we ensure that you can start your project quickly — without hassle. Need a larger loan with a long term? Check out our option - business loan plus!
