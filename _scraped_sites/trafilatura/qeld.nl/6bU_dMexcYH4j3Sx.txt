The terms and conditions for a business loan with Qeld, part of Qred Bank, are simple and clear. Here are the key eligibility criteria you must meet:

- Registration with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK): Your company must be registered with the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands.
- Applicant's minimum age: The entrepreneur applying for the loan must be at least 18 years old.
- Business activity and stability: Qeld assesses your company's current financial situation and activity to ensure that you are able to repay the loan. Although there are no fixed turnover requirements, your company must be active and stable enough.
- Flexibility in repayment: Our business loans do not have a fixed term. This means that you can repay early at no extra cost, which offers flexibility for entrepreneurs who do not want a long-term commitment.

These simple conditions make it possible for entrepreneurs to borrow quickly and flexibly. When the loan is approved, between €5,000 and €500,000, the amount will be in your account within 24 hours, so you can invest directly in your business without unnecessary delays.
