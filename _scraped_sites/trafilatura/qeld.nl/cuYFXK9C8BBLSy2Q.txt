All Dutch limited liability business, partnerships, sole proprietorships / traders, and more can apply and be approved a loan, as long as the valid chamber of commerce number is presented and the director or the company is resident in the Netherlands. It can be a proud, old business, or a brand new startup, large or small. We work with businesses in virtually every industry, from north to south - even businesses with a checkered credit history can qualify. We evaluate each business individually - the key for us is that there is a solid business idea and qualified business owners behind the company.
