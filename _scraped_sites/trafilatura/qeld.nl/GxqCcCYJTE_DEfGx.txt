Qeld offers flexible and rapidly disbursed business loans for small hospitality businesses, such as restaurants and cafes, with amounts up to €500,000. These loans are ideal for investments in equipment, marketing, staffing, or seasonal needs. The application is simple and takes just one minute, with a fixed monthly price and a flexible duration.

Normally, banks are often skeptical about lending money to small restaurants. They are seen as risky investments, especially when it comes to a new restaurant. Unfortunately, even if a restaurant has positive reviews, a long history and no payment arrears, many restaurants still receive a rejection from the bank.

At Qeld, we want to help you bypass the banks by offering you a restaurant loan. Our small business loans are perfect for restaurants, cafes and pizzerias, among others. Make a request and you will receive a response within an hour, and the money can be paid out the same day. We'll make sure you get the money you need — up to €500,000.

Should you invest in new equipment, staff, or marketing? We have the loan you need!

Running a restaurant isn't easy. You need to be able to manage customers, suppliers, marketing, staff and food at the same time. The whole of the Netherlands is full of fantastic small entrepreneurs in the hospitality industry.

There are many reasons why Qeld is so popular among restaurant owners. Cash flow often varies, for example depending on the season. There may also be a need when you need to renovate, hire staff or promote your restaurant. Then it may be time for a business loan.

Our loans are suitable for many different needs and help you run your restaurant successfully.
