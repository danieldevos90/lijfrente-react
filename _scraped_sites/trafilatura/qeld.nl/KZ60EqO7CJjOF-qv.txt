No. At Qeld, we are honest and upfront about our cost. We don't charge a start-up fee and have no hidden costs. We simply charge a standard monthly fee for the usage of our loan, plus monthly amortisation. When you combine the two costs (monthly fee and amortisation) you have the total sum you owe each month. No hidden charges or fluctuating costs. Easy and transparent!
