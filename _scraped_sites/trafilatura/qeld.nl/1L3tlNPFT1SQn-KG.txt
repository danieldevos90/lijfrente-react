Let's start with the question: What is a microloan? A microloan, also known as microfinance, is a small business loan between €1,000 and €500,000. Although this form of credit once started to support people in developing countries, it is now also a common form of financing in the Netherlands. It is primarily used as a way to help small entrepreneurs launch their businesses or expand their existing operations.

First, the loans are relatively small, which means that the entrepreneur is not overwhelmed by a large debt. This makes it much more accessible for small entrepreneurs to get financing.

Secondly, a micro loan often offers more flexibility than a traditional loan. For small and medium-sized businesses, it is often nice not to be stuck with a business loan for a long time. This form of business lending is often associated with a shorter term and, in some cases, even without a binding term. This means that you can repay your loan in full at any time and are therefore not tied to anything.

Furthermore, microloans can help entrepreneurs grow and expand their business. With the loans, entrepreneurs can, for example, invest in new equipment, marketing campaigns or the purchase of inventory. This can help their business grow and make more profit, which in turn can be invested in further expansion.

In addition, getting a microloan can also help build a credit history. This can be important for future financing opportunities, as having a good credit history can help you access larger loans or other financial products.

Microloans are a powerful SME loan for small entrepreneurs who struggle to access traditional finance. They can help grow their business and build a credit history. Do you want to apply for a microloan?

A microloan can positively influence an entrepreneur's creditworthiness if the loan is repaid by agreement. This is because successful repayments are recorded and contribute to a positive credit history, which can facilitate access to future financing.

With Qeld, the only conditions are that you are registered as an entrepreneur with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK) and reside in the Netherlands. The conditions for microloans may vary depending on the provider. These may relate to the interest rate, the term of the loan, repayment terms, and any requirements for providing collateral or personal guarantees. It is important to carefully consider and compare these conditions before deciding to take out a microloan.

At Qeld, it doesn't matter what industry your company is active in. However, it is important to know that no loans can be granted to foundations or N.V. ' s. While microloans are widely accessible, some lenders may have specific requirements for the type of company or sector in which it operates. This depends on the risk profile that the lender uses. It is advisable to check this with the lender beforehand.
