A self-employed loan can be an essential source of financing for independent entrepreneurs who want to grow, invest or guide their business through difficult times. Whether you choose a business loan, self-employed loan, factoring or a leasing option, it's important to do good research and choose the right partner who understands your specific needs. Qeld is ready to help you with flexible and transparent financing solutions designed to help your business thrive.

As a self-employed person (Self-employed Without Staff), you have the freedom to follow your own path and build your own business. While this offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges, such as finding the right funding to grow your business or cover unexpected costs. A self-employed loan, also known as a business loan for freelancers, can be an excellent solution to financially support your company and take advantage of opportunities.

A business loan to zzp is a specific form of financing that is aimed at independent entrepreneurs. Unlike private loans, a business loan is meant to be invested in the growth and development of your business. For example, buying new equipment, expanding your workspace or funding a marketing campaign. The purpose of a business loan is always focused on strengthening your business, not on personal expenses.

When taking out a business loan for freelancers, you will receive a pre-agreed amount from the lender. You pay this amount back in fixed installments, often with interest, over a certain period of time. It can range from short-term loans of a few months to long-term loans that last a few years, depending on your needs and the lender's terms.

Taking out a business loan as a self-employed person can offer several advantages:

**Improving liquidity**

A loan can help you improve your cash flow, especially during periods where customer payments are delayed.

**Investing in growth**

With extra funding, you can invest in expanding your business, such as hiring additional staff, upgrading your equipment, or exploring new markets.

**Progress in difficult times**

Unexpected costs, such as a faulty machine or a drop in turnover, can be covered with the help of a self-employed credit, so you don't get into trouble.

There are various ways to finance your business as a self-employed person. Depending on your specific situation and business goals, one of the following options may be appropriate:

- Business loan for a self-employed person

The classic self-employed business loan is one of the most common forms of financing. Here, you will receive a one-off amount that you will pay back over a fixed period. This is a good option if you have to make a large investment, such as purchasing equipment or renovating.

- ZZP Loan

A self-employed loan is more flexible than a traditional loan. With a loan, you get access to a pre-approved amount that you can withdraw and repay as needed. It works similar to a revolving credit and is ideal for freelancers who need flexibility, for example when income changes.

- Factoring

Factoring is a form of financing where you sell your outstanding invoices to a factoring company. This immediately pays you a percentage of the invoice amount, so you don't have to wait for your customer to pay. This can be especially useful if you work with long payment terms.

- Leasing

When leasing, you are, as it were, renting assets, such as a vehicle or equipment, from a leasing company. This means that you don't have to invest a large amount at once, but pay an amount each month. At the end of the lease period, you can often choose to buy the leased goods or terminate the lease.

As a self-employed person, there are a number of things to consider before taking out a self-employed business loan:

- Determine your funding needs

Before you apply for a loan, it's important to be clear about how much money you need and what for. A well-thought-out plan increases the chance of approving your loan. - Look at the terms and conditions

Not all loans are the same. Note the term, the interest rate, any early repayment penalties and other conditions that the loan involves. - Be prepared for a credit check

Many lenders will check your creditworthiness. Make sure your finances are in order and that you have addressed any backlogs.

You can apply for a self-employed business loan at various financial institutions, such as banks, lenders and specialized providers of self-employed financing. The process often goes like this:

1. Submit an application: You start by submitting an application, providing information about your business, your income and your desired loan amount.

2. Assessment: The lender will review your application based on your creditworthiness and business details.

3. Offer received: If approved, you will receive an offer with the loan terms, such as the amount, the term and the interest rate.

4. Sign and receive: After signing the contract, the money will be transferred to your business account. You can now start executing your plans.
