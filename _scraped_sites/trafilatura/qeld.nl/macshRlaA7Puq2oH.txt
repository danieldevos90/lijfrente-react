****Qeld offers flexible business loans of up to €500,000 for taxi companies to invest in fleet, technology and staff. Our loans are easy to apply for, with fixed monthly costs and fast payouts, so you can grow and improve your taxi business.

The taxi industry is essential for the Dutch transport sector, but running a successful taxi company requires continued investments. This includes maintaining and expanding your fleet, improving technology for efficiency, and training staff. At Qeld, we understand the unique challenges and needs of the taxi industry, which is why we offer flexible business loans of up to €500,000, especially for taxi operators who want to grow their business.

For a taxi company, a reliable and well-maintained fleet is essential. Customers expect clean, comfortable vehicles that arrive on time and take them safely to their destinations. With a Qeld business loan, you can invest in new vehicles or upgrade your existing fleet. Whether it's electric cars, luxury vehicles or wheelchair-accessible taxis, we'll help you with financing. It's important to choose vehicles that not only meet the needs of your customers, but also meet the environmental requirements and government regulations. A well-maintained fleet can also help reduce maintenance costs in the long term.

A stationary taxi means lost income. Regular maintenance and timely repairs are therefore crucial to keep vehicles in optimal condition and to ensure that you can always keep driving. With a Qeld loan, you can proactively invest in maintenance and carry out the necessary repairs when necessary. This prevents vehicles from unexpectedly shutting down and keeps your business running smoothly. A well-maintained fleet contributes to the safety of both your drivers and customers and improves the reliability of your services.

Fuel costs can be a significant burden for a taxi company, especially in times of rising prices. Investing in fuel-efficient vehicles or even an electric fleet can help reduce long-term operational costs. Many taxi companies are increasingly opting for hybrid or electric vehicles to cut costs and reduce their environmental footprint. With a Qeld business loan, you can make the switch to more environmentally friendly options and benefit from lower fuel costs and maintenance costs. In addition, sustainability is playing an increasingly important role in customer preferences, which can make your company more attractive to a wide audience.

The taxi industry is changing rapidly, partly due to technological innovations. Modern technology can help plan rides more efficiently, make payments easier, and improve customer communication. By investing in trip planning systems, GPS, payment systems and customer apps, you can improve the customer experience and increase the efficiency of your business. A loan from Qeld offers you the opportunity to implement the technology that helps your company to compete better in the market. Efficiency gains such as route optimization and GPS tracking can save costs and increase your drivers' productivity.

It is important that your taxi company is visible to potential customers. A strong online presence, great reviews, and an effective marketing strategy can help attract new customers and keep existing ones coming back. With a loan from Qeld, you can invest in a professional website, social media marketing, and possibly customer loyalty programs. These types of investments ensure that your taxi company stands out from the competition and that customers know where to find your services when they need a taxi.

Good drivers are the core of a taxi company. By investing in training and professional development, you can ensure that your drivers meet high quality standards and always work customer-oriented. In addition, a Qeld business loan can help you hire additional staff when the demand for your services increases. This way, you can grow your business and serve customers faster and better. Investing in driver training, safety training and customer focus can contribute to better service and thus to your company's reputation.

At Qeld, we understand that entrepreneurs in the taxi industry need speed and flexibility. That's why our application process is simple and fast: you can submit an application online within one minute, and you'll often receive a response within an hour. In many cases, the money can even be paid out the same day, so you can invest directly in your business. Our loans are flexible, with no mandatory term, and with a fixed monthly price, so you always know exactly where you stand.

With a business loan Qeld gives you the financial space to invest in growth and innovation within your taxi company. Whether you want to invest in your fleet, technology, marketing, or staff, we'll help you achieve your goals and provide better service to your customers. Qeld is ready to support your taxi company in every phase of your business.
