Businesses that sell goods and/or services to other businesses, for example, lease companies, IT-services, inventory and business supplies, professional cleaners, financial advisors, etc. are eligible for a Qeld partnership. If you or your company cater to the business market, not the consumer market, you can become a Qeld partner and help other businesses find the right financing for your products.
