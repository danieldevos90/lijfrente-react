Offer and improve our services. We process personal data to provide our services and offer business loans to small and medium-sized businesses. As part of this process, we also collect personal data to improve our service. Below is an overview of how we process personal data and the legal basis for processing:



The following services involve Qeld giving you a credit :

- Qeld business loans
- Qeld Factoring - factoring business (purchase of invoices)

Your personal data is shared with companies that perform a credit assessment and other suppliers in order to make a credit worthiness check when you’re applying for a business loan (Qeld loan) the Qeld Factoring service.

To be able to offer our Services, we do a credit assessment of you (credit worthiness check). The credit assessment is based on contact- and identification information, information on how you interact with Qeld and other financial information. Financial information includes information that is provided externally by companies that perform credit assessments, based on, for example, income and payment defaults.

The credit assessment is based on contact- and identification information and information on how you interact with Qeld. This includes how you interact and communicate with us but also financial information that you provide us, for instance transactional records, bank account statements and external information from credit assessment companies.

We can come to use your contact information in order to communicate with you. We can do this either by performing customer surveys or to send out offers regarding our products/services based on our relationship with you. If you choose to not receive such communication/information, you can at any time contact us at privacy@qeld.nl.

To be able to give you customized offers and discounts etc, we look at information on how you interact with Qeld, your contact- and identification information, information about products/services and your usage of these services. This processing may constitute profiling (see excerpt 6 for more information). The information is the foundation regarding Qeld's marketing- and customer analysis and the development of statistical information. We customize offers where we use contact- and identification information, information on payment patterns, and your interaction with Qeld in order to improve our services and better our offers. We can utilize information in order to present personal offers via mail, email, text message, or other digital channels.

You can unsubscribe from customized personal offers either by clicking on the link in the digital communication or by contacting us directly (see contact information below).

In those cases where Qeld processes your personal information based on your consent or expressive consent (for instance when you give us a power of attorney for a third party to get access to your information, or give us additional information that constitutes sensitive data). You can at any time revoke this consent by contacting us. To revoke your consent will not lead to any lesser version of our service since we don’t need this information to offer our services.

“Profiling” means automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, for example in order to analyse or predict aspects of your financial situation or your preferences, such as purchase interests. We use profiling based on the personal data we have about you in order to take individual or automated decisions about you, for the following purposes:

- Predicting what marketing content would be of interest to you. You can always object to this and deregister from the marketing and this profiling, by contacting us. For further information about our processing of personal data for marketing purposes, see Section 4 above);
- Deciding what offers that might suit you;
- Deciding on the most suitable way to contact you concerning outstanding debt;

In addition, some of our Services use profiling in order to deliver the applicable Service to you, for example delivering relevant financial insights to you, or to select which offers to give you, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Service.

*Decisions with legal or similarly significant effect*

Automated decision making with legal effects, or automated decisions with similarly significant effect, means that some decisions in our Services are solely based on automatic means, without any interaction from any of our employees, and carry a significant impact on you as a consumer with them. By making such decisions in an automated fashion, Qeld increases objectivity and transparency in the decisions when offering those Services.

We use this type of automated decision making when we:

- Decide to approve your application to use a credit Service;

- Decide not to approve your application to use a credit Service;

- Decide whether you pose a fraud- or money laundering risk, if our processing reveals that you display behaviour consistent with money laundering or fraudulent conduct, that your behaviour is inconsistent with your previous use of our Services,or that you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. In relevant cases, Qeld also checks whether or not a specific customer is listed on a so-called sanction list.

You always have the right to challenge an automated decision which carries a legal or similarly significant effect (together with the profiling connected to it), by contacting us using the email address privacy@qeld.nl. A Qeld employee from the customer team will then look at your case.
