# Funding goal

A business loan is meant to take steps with your company. Whether you want to invest, pre-finance, make a major purchase or just need a temporary bonus. With a business loan, you can get back to work.

## Invoice financing

In the Netherlands, an invoice is open for an average of 39 days. When you work with larger organizations or the government, this can be even much longer. With invoice financing, you can pay invoices on time and regain control of your cash flow. View invoice financing.

## Refinancing


In a refinancing, also known as refinancing, an existing loan or financial obligation is replaced by a new loan with potentially more favorable terms, such as a lower interest rate or a longer term.

## Pre-financing

Pre-financing is a form of financing where a company receives external funds for future income. It's a powerful tool for effective financial management and growth for entrepreneurs.

## Car financing


Thanks to the business loan, you don't have to wait long until you can finance the business car. This means that you can carry out business activities faster and more efficiently and maintain cash flow for other business needs.

## Hospitality Financing

Hospitality financing covers a wide range of costs, from start-up costs to ongoing expenses such as staff and marketing. A solid financial basis is crucial for growth, with targeted investments in, for example, inventory, marketing and staff development.

## Financing inventory


Buying inventory, you can't escape it. The inventory you buy should be used to make a profit. So it's the hub of the web for your company. But before that profit is there, considerable investments must be made. This can make a significant dent in your working capital. Inventory financing is then not a bad idea.

We look at this per situation. We think it is important that you can afford the loan. Swishfund provides loans ranging from €3,000 to €500,000. We can calculate your credit space without obligation and free of charge.

Once your application is completed and reviewed positively, we will deposit the money into your business account within 24 hours.

During the application, you can specify the desired amount, the term and purpose of the loan. In addition, we always ask you to upload a transaction summary of your business bank account in the MT940 file format. You can easily download such an overview from your bank's online environment. After we have calculated your credit space, we will contact you for the next steps. Depending on the size of the request, we need a number of additional documents.

The cost of your loan consists of a one-off closing fee and a monthly interest. The amount of these costs is percentage and therefore depends on the loan amount. The standard closing fee is 2% with a minimum amount of €650. The monthly interest is determined based on your company's risk profile. You will receive a final proposal after reviewing your application. To give you a clear picture of the costs for business loans, we have drawn up two examples, showing the possible costs in a so-called UKO (Uniform Credit Overview). See examples here.
