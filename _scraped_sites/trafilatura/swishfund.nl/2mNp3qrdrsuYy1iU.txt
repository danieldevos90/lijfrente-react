Our Mission

## The straightforward financier for entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs are the heart of our economy and we support them where possible. Since 2016, with top entrepreneur and co-founder Pieter Schoen, we have been offering financing solutions to SMEs. With us, entrepreneurs can borrow money quickly and easily to seize opportunities, grow or pay bills.

We know the entrepreneurial mentality and understand the challenges. We are a certified SME financier and support entrepreneurs throughout the life of their company.

## Swishfund Recognized MKB-Financier

Reliability is a key factor for you when securing a business loan, and at Swishfund, we value it just as much. As a recognized SME financier and a member of the SME Financing Foundation (Stichting MKB), we operate in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Small Business Credit. This means we adhere to clear and fair rules, ensuring we provide you as an entrepreneur with transparent, reliable, and responsible financing solutions that perfectly align with your needs.

## Continue with Swishfund

Pieter Schoen, famous for the TV show Dragons' Den, saw a big opportunity in the world of corporate finance in 2016. He noticed that SMEs were increasingly in need of fast and flexible loans, while traditional banks were increasingly giving zero response, were too slow in their decision-making or required an abundance of documentation. As a true entrepreneur, Pieter knew how important it is to be able to react quickly when financial opportunities come up.

With that vision, he and two partners founded Swishfund in 2016 to move the financial market. Swishfund is an innovative fintech that offers business loans easily and quickly. The goal? Give entrepreneurs the flexibility to make financial decisions quickly so they can capitalize on opportunities and grow their business.
