## Introduction

The operating budget is part of your company's financial plan. This budget is an estimate of the turnover and costs of the coming years. Based on the costs of previous years, you determine how much turnover is needed to cover the costs. In most cases, three years are looked ahead.

In this article, we'll tell you why you're making an operating budget. We've also added an example so you can get started yourself right away.

**Why are you making this budget?**

An operating budget gives you insight into the future of your company. Then we are mainly talking about its profitability. With this budget, you list the expected turnover and costs.

**This has a number of advantages:**

- You know how much turnover you need to cover the costs.
- You know how much turnover you need to make a profit.
- You can make adjustments when reality differs from expectations.
- You can immediately see when you need more money to cover the costs. You can already anticipate this.
- Need more money? Then a loan can be the solution. Some financiers ask for the operating budget in order to take out the loan. Because you've made the budget, you're speeding up the application process.

**Part of the financial plan**

The operating budget is part of your company's financial plan. This financial plan is again part of the business plan. This shows whether your company is financially viable. For you, as an entrepreneur, it is nice to provide insight into this. But even if you are looking for financing, some parties will ask for such a budget. The bank in particular sets these requirements when applying for funding.
