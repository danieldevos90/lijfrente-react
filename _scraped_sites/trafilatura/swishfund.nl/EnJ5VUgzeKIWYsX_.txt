## When can I apply for a business loan?

## Wat kost geld lenen bij Swishfund?

We believe in being transparent about our terms and rates. When determining loan rates, we consider various factors. We'll explain how this works, so you know exactly what to expect.

#### Here’s how we calculate your rate

###### 1

The market interest rate is the prevailing rate in the financial market. It influences the base rate of your loan.

###### 2

These are the operational costs we charge for our services, including issuing and managing your loan.

###### 3

We assess your ability to repay the loan based on your creditworthiness and payment history. Lower risk often results in a lower rate. Providing collateral can also help secure a reduced rate.

###### 4

The loan amount affects the closing commission. This is 2% of the total loan amount, with a minimum amount of €650.

We only provide to companies that are registered with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK) in the Netherlands with a business bank account. In addition, you must be economically active for at least one year and have a turnover of at least €50,000 in the past year.

Swishfund is a recognized SME financier that has been supporting entrepreneurs in the Netherlands since 2016 with fast and accessible business financing, combining the efficiency of fintech technology with personalized service.

We look at this per situation. We think it is important that you can afford the loan. Swishfund provides loans ranging from €3,000 to €500,000. We can calculate your credit space without obligation and free of charge.

Once your application is completed and reviewed positively, we will deposit the money into your business account within 24 hours.

During the application, you can specify the desired amount, the term and purpose of the loan. In addition, we always ask you to upload a transaction summary of your business bank account in the MT940 file format. You can easily download such an overview from your bank's online environment. After we have calculated your credit space, we will contact you for the next steps. Depending on the size of the request, we need a number of additional documents.

The cost of your loan consists of a one-off closing fee and a monthly interest. The amount of these costs is percentage and therefore depends on the loan amount. The standard closing fee is 2% with a minimum amount of €650. The monthly interest is determined based on your company's risk profile. You will receive a final proposal after reviewing your application. To give you a clear picture of the costs for business loans, we have drawn up two examples, showing the possible costs in a so-called UKO (Uniform Credit Overview). See examples here.
