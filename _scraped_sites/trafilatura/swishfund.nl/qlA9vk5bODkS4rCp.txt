# Business loan rates

Do you want to take out a business loan and are you curious about the interest rate? We are happy to explain how interest is calculated and what you should take into account when it comes to interest on business loans.

## Wat kost geld lenen bij Swishfund?

We like to be clear and clear about our terms and rates. When determining our loan rates, we look at various components. We'll explain how this works, so you know exactly what to expect.

#### This is how we calculate your rate:

#### Label I

###### 1

Market interest rate is the interest rate on the financial market. This affects the base rate of your loan.

#### Label II

###### 2

We assess the chances of you repaying the loan based on your creditworthiness and payment history. Less risk often means a lower rate. If you have collateral, this can also lead to a lower rate.

#### Label III

###### 3

The loan amount affects the closing commission. This is 2% of the total loan amount, with a minimum amount of €650.

#### Label IV

###### 4

We make repaying your loan as easy as possible with two options: **daily direct debit** whether **automatic pin curing**. We usually use direct debit, but if you work in the hospitality or retail sector, credit card scrolling can be useful. How does it work? You pay back a fixed percentage of your debit card turnover. You pay more on busy days, less on quiet days. This way, you keep an overview.** boetevrij (extra) aflossen, **wanneer dat voor jou goed uitkomt**.**

## What is market interest rate?

Market interest rate is the interest rate that applies to the capital and money markets at a given time. By the money market, we mean the market for short-term loans up to a maximum of 2 years. The capital market represents long-term loans, such as bonds. For both, the interest rate changes continuously. The amount of this interest rate affects the interest rate on a business loan.

## How is the risk profile determined?


As an entrepreneur, you run the risk that you will no longer be able to bear the financial burdens of your company. The lender, with whom the loan is taken out, runs the risk that the entrepreneur will not be able to repay the loan amount. In order to guarantee a good and realistic agreement for both parties, the risk profile is drawn up. The lower the risk, the lower the rate. The risk profile consists of a number of points.

## What is the loan amount?

The loan amount is nothing more or less than the amount you want to borrow. The amount depends on the risk profile. As a result, a higher or lower loan amount may be recommended after analysis. The loan amount is not unlimited; each lender has set a maximum amount themselves. This may vary from provider to provider. The amount of the loan amount can also vary by loan form. For a business loan (current account), the loan amount is often higher than for a business loan for a one-off investment. With Swishfund's handy tool, you can easily and quickly get an indication of how much you can borrow. In addition, the loan amount affects the closing costs, which is often a minimum amount, which becomes more with a higher loan amount. At Swishfund, we have a minimum of €650, -.

## What influence does repayment have?

The contract states how much you have to repay and within what period it must be repaid. The method of repayment may vary from lender to lender. With Swishfund, you pay off per day, so you don't have to pay back a large amount at once. If you opt for peanut cream, you will pay back more on busy days than on quiet days. Do you have a stroke of luck? Then you can choose to pay extra early or in the meantime. If you do this, you can get a discount on the amount still due. So that's something to think about when taking out a business loan.
