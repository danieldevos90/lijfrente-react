## Introduction

Whether you're just starting out or have owned your own business for years, this question remains relevant at every stage of your entrepreneurship. If you have a store or restaurant, you know it used to be enough to make your shop window attractive and put a sign outside. With the shift from offline to online, you can no longer avoid complementing these traditional ways of marketing with digital tactics. Quite a bit is possible here! In this blog, we'll discuss 5 ways to get started with online marketing and find new customers online.

### The shift from offline to online consumer behavior

But first, what about the shift from offline to online? Although we have, of course, seen for years that consumers are increasingly shopping, searching and comparing online, the current crisis has brought digitization into a real fast stream.

For example, sports teachers were suddenly forced to offer their lessons digitally through videos, food producers learned that they could also (collectively) offer their offerings online on platforms such as Support Your Locals, and hospitality entrepreneurs came up with online initiatives such as the Tasty Walk to still be able to serve people.

Not only entrepreneurs, Dutch consumers also became more adventurous (in their shopping habits) during this period. Many shoppers (re) discovered new online services and/or products. A large part made purchases at web shops that were not visited before. As many as 70% of them plan to make purchases at these online stores in the future! These are interesting numbers. Doing business online offers prospects for many entrepreneurs.

#### Tips for maximum results

It's wise to first choose one channel that you like the most and that best suits your business, situation, and budget. Focus entirely on that one channel. Once that works and produces results, you may be able to expand with another channel, but nothing has to be done. It is most important that you do not “do everything a little bit”, but work in a focused and effective way.

To be even more successful, you can improve your online campaigns with data collected in your physical location. For example, you can let people subscribe to your newsletter at your store or restaurant and receive deals, news, and promotions. That way, you can offer a personalized experience that better converts to purchases. Another example is actively asking for reviews so that you are clearly visible online when someone visits you. Get creative and use it to your advantage!
