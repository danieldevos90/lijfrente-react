# Swishfund launches Smart Track

#### Merel Nijland

## Introduction

The fastest way to request short-term financial support — Amsterdam, 08-09-2020

At Swishfund, we closely monitor developments in the business market. We saw that people have an enormous need for speed when applying for (short-term) business loans.

If you look at the traditional way of assessing like banks do, this is inefficient and time-consuming. You need to be able to show (positive) historical data, and just requesting it is quite a process. So that doesn't serve market demand at all.

As an entrepreneur, you want quick feedback, and you don't have the desire or time to wait long for it at all. Makes sense! With this in mind, we started tinkering with a new model: Smart Track. In this news article, we'd love to tell you more about it.

*If you want to get off the ground, you need speed. — Leon Doornenbal, Managing Director — Swishfund*

### How does Smart Track work?

We wanted to get to the root of the problem: requesting and reviewing the annual results. That could be a lot better. That is why we mainly look at what is currently on the *bank account *happens: in other words, the current transactions. We find it much more important whether someone can and wants to pay. With this rather limited information, we can already do a good and quick assessment.

By using technology and big data, we make it possible to provide loans fully automated. Based on data and algorithms, we can review requests faster and more accurately. The request via the website is a piece of cake. And if it is approved, you can expect the money in your account within 24 hours. In addition, a manual check is done. Convenience serves people!


This concerns short-term financing of up to €10,000 with a maximum term of 12 months. Generally, these types of financing are used for investments that have no depreciation and are short-term. Think of purchasing stock for web shops. But, you can also use it as a bridge. For example, with a debtor who you know is coming in but is still taking a while. Or an opportunity to gain a purchasing advantage.

#### And what about COVID-19?

Swishfund thinks in terms of possibilities. We are trying to assess how much you are affected by the current crisis. If you have an event agency, you will benefit better from government regulations, but if you want to make home delivery possible as a restaurant, we would heartily welcome that. Feel free to take contact contact us if you need customized advice.
