# What does it cost and what do I need to provide?


At Swishfund, we like to be as transparent as possible about our rates and requirements. Unfortunately, we cannot show a uniform rate in advance, but loans are already issued with 1% interest. The amount of the final interest rate depends on three factors: the loan amount, the financial health of your company and any underlying securities. The closing costs and the interest due are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of the loan. During the term of the loan, these costs must be paid daily in equal amounts, together with the repayment of the loan. That makes it clear and very organized. And should you still want to repay the loan faster? Then, of course, we do not charge any extra costs for this. In addition, all kinds of data need to be known to us in order to give a good opinion of the risk profile, which is why below is an overview of the requirements per size of the loan.

##### Essentials

Swishfund assesses your creditworthiness primarily on a printout of your bank transactions. When requesting higher loan amounts, we would like to receive some additional information to properly assess whether we can help you and at what rate. However, we will not ask for business plans or endless lists of answers. We understand only too well that time costs money. And apparently, we are doing a good job, as many customers have come back to us several times.
