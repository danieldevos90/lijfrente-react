**A suitable form of financing for every entrepreneur**

Alternative finance is a broad concept, there are many different forms of financing. For this reason, there is therefore appropriate financing for every entrepreneur in every business phase. Think of a party that only pre-finances your invoices to a platform where you can start a crowdfunding campaign.

**Quick and easy processing of the request**

Characteristic of alternative forms of financing is that you can switch quickly. They keep up with the developments in the market. Most of them therefore have a quick and easy application process.

In general, they use smart technology. They can process data quickly and efficiently, which they use to improve the service and product. Entrepreneurs benefit from this technology because the ease of use is constantly being improved.

**Focused on the needs of the entrepreneur**

You, the entrepreneur, are at the center of alternative financiers. Flexibility and moving with the customer are characteristics of these financiers. Of course, they have fixed processes and conditions that you must meet, but the most suitable solution is always sought.

To give an example; the repayment of your financing can be arranged in several ways. Do you have a lot of income from debit card transactions? Then you can repay based on your debit card turnover. Do you have a seasonal business? Then you pay an agreed percentage of your turnover, so you can repay more in the high season and not get into trouble in the low season.
