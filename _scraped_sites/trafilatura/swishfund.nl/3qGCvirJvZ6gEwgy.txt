#### Merel Nijland

## Introduction

But before that profit is there, considerable investments must be made. This can make a significant dent in your working capital. Inventory financing is then not a bad idea. In this blog, we'll tell you more about financing inventory.

### What is inventory financing?

Inventory financing basically consists of two forms. First of all, it** long-term credit**. As the name suggests, this is suitable for ongoing support. Here, you withdraw money when necessary and only pay interest on what you withdraw. This long-term loan is generally used to finance “iron stocks”. This is the minimum amount of inventory you need to stay in business.

And then there is the **business loan**. This loan is suitable for periodic and/or seasonal purchases. This loan is short-term and is therefore suitable for absorbing peak times, such as the holidays. After all, it is not necessary to continuously pay the costs of a long loan if you only have to make large purchases at (a) certain time (s). The amount of this amount is usually equal to the purchase value.

*Inventory financing in the form of a short-term business loan is the smartest option to temporarily create additional financial space, for example for purchasing your inventory.*
