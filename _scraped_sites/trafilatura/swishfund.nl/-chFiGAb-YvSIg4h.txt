## Chocolaterie de Berekuil

“My wife and I wanted to open a chocolate shop in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel. People thought we were crazy because there would be no interest in a village with 1500 inhabitants at all. But where there's a will, there's a way, and 24 years later, we're still here!” The small shop on the Kalverstaat in the town of South Holland processes around eleven thousand kilos of chocolate per year. It's hard to imagine Peter and his team making and selling it: champagne bottles, boats, toolboxes and even the Ahoy has been made of chocolate before. Peter Schaper can talk for hours about that great passion: chocolate! Two years ago, he changed course. The chocolate shop was expanded to include a pastry shop. A dream of his son Luke. After Luuk had successfully completed his education in Bruges, the chocolate shop was extensively renovated so that there was space to realize this dream.

### The challenge

With two companies, a chocolate shop and a pastry shop, twice as many raw materials are also needed. That required extra credit. Thanks to the raw materials, plenty of production can be done. “The money will come back to us by itself. The last payment period was recently, so now we are completely clean.” According to the chocolatier, the request was very easy. After an introductory meeting, figures had to be submitted and after the credit check, the money was in his account within five business days. “I came across Swishfund in the bakery magazine and that caught my attention. It has provided an enormous amount of peace and quiet. I was able to continue producing products without being completely dependent on payment from suppliers.”
