- Visitors' IP addresses and data collected via cookies (see our cookie statement)
- information that you actively provide to us by filling out a contact form or by signing up for our newsletter.

*Debtor list*

As part of assessing credit applications, we may ask our customers to provide securities. One possible security is the pledge of your claims against your debtors. To establish this security, we may ask you (monthly) to provide us with a debtor list. This debtor list will be presented to the tax authorities to register the pledge. This list includes the name, address and outstanding amount of your debtors.

We also use the debtor list to grant credit and assess debtor risk.


*Creditor list*

As part of the review of credit applications, we ask our customers to provide a list of its creditors, including the outstanding amounts. This creditor list may include third party personal data, such as name, address and the outstanding amount of your creditors, invoice date and invoice payment date. We use the creditor list to determine the possible credit that we provide to our customer and to review and monitor credit applications.


*Personal data in our clients' bank transactions *

As part of assessing credit applications, we ask our customers to provide us with the bank transactions (from 12 to 24 months ago) from the account where they receive (pin) payments, via a file to be provided or via digital access. These bank transactions may include the personal data of third parties. We use bank transactions to determine the possible credit that we provide to our customer and to review and monitor credit applications.

We may also request and use the bank transactions during the term of the credit to assess the correct use of the credit, to monitor our customer's repayment obligations and as part of an ongoing risk assessment of the credit provided.

Swishfund also uses this data to improve its services, more specifically to improve the service's analysis model. This data is aggregated and used anonymously as much as possible.


##### 4. Share with others

Swishfund maakt bij het aanbieden van haar dienst in sommige gevallen gebruik van derde partijen, bijvoorbeeld voor het hosten van haar centrale database of voor het verkrijgen van incassomachtigingen. Met bedrijven die jouw gegevens verwerken in onze opdracht, sluiten wij een verwerkersovereenkomst o.a. om te zorgen voor een passend niveau van beveiliging en vertrouwelijkheid van jouw gegevens. Swishfund blijft verantwoordelijk voor deze verwerkingen.

If you no longer meet your repayment obligations, we can hand over your claim for collection. In that case, we provide your data to a collection agency, which processes your data on our behalf.

We may also share your personal data with parties that finance us in order to control the value of our loan portfolio and to control the securities we provide to them, in the form of pledging the claims.

In addition, we may share your information if we are legally required to do so, in the context of an investigation into fraudulent or illegal activity, or when necessary in a court of law, or if we deem it necessary to defend our own rights.

Finally, Swishfund believes it is important that your personal data is stored within the European Economic Area (hereinafter: “EEA”). If in the future, Swishfund decides to also store personal data outside the EEA, it will inform you. Wherever Swishfund stores personal data, it will ensure that this storage is always in accordance with the law.


##### 5. Testing and registration with BKR

In the application process, business owners, who are listed at the Chamber of Commerce or as specified by you to us, can be tested at the Credit Registration Office (BKR) Foundation in Tiel.

The person making the application is responsible for ensuring that all parties and shareholders associated with the borrower's business are informed that they can be reviewed as part of the application.

If the outcome of the credit application is positive and credit is made, Swishfund reports this agreement to the BKR. BKR processes this data in the Central Credit Information System (CKI) for the purpose of preventing and limiting credit and payment risks for affiliated institutions and preventing and limiting the overlending of those involved (borrowers and guarantors), as well as to contribute to preventing problematic debt situations. As part of the aforementioned objective, this data is made available by BKR to the affiliated institutions, which is possible in a factual and statistically edited form.

In addition to registering the agreement, Swishfund has also undertaken the obligation to report to BKR any arrears in fulfilling the payment obligations under this agreement of more than 2 months. This can have consequences for any subsequent funding request.


##### 6. Your rights with regard to data processing

If you want to know what information Swishfund collects about you, you can ask Swishfund to send an overview of this information. You can make this request by sending an email to privacy@swishfund.nl. To make sure that the information you request actually belongs to you, we ask you to send a copy of a valid ID. We request that you make the social security number shown on your ID unreadable. Swishfund will respond to your request within four (4) weeks.

If, based on the overview, you want to have your personal data changed, deleted, blocked or restricted processing by Swishfund, you can send a new request to the address mentioned above. Swishfund will also respond to this request within four (4) weeks. If Swishfund decides not to carry out your request, it will indicate why it will not do so.

Finally, in some cases, you have the right to object or have your data transferred in an appropriate form. In addition, you have the right to file a complaint with Swishfund or the Data Protection Authority. You can exercise these rights by sending an email to privacy@swishfund.nl. Swishfund will respond to your request within four weeks.


##### 7. Security

Swishfund takes appropriate measures to prevent misuse, loss, unauthorized access, unwanted disclosure and unauthorized modification of personal data under our responsibility.

Your data is stored on data servers within the EEA and will not be processed outside the EEA unless you are notified.

If you feel that your data is not properly secured or if there are indications of abuse, please contact us at privacy@swishfund.nl.


##### 8. Changes

We may change this Privacy Statement and/or our policy with regard to the processing of personal data at any time, including in connection with changes in regulations or technological developments. If Swishfund makes fundamental changes to the change to this Privacy Statement or if the changes otherwise affect you (for example, if Swishfund were to process your data for a different purpose than previously communicated to you), Swishfund will inform you of these changes before the changes are made. Here, Swishfund will explain what possible consequences the change may have for you.
