# The 5 trends for entrepreneurs in 2021

#### Merel Nijland

## Introduction

Entrepreneurial Netherlands is leaving 2020 behind and is cautiously focusing on 2021. After a difficult year with issues such as the corona crisis and the nitrogen problem, this year will not be easy. However, there are still chances to take! It's just a matter of seeing and seizing those opportunities. That's why, in this blog, we explain the 5 trends for this year, to give your business a flying start.

#### Trend 1: Offering Online Services

A positive aspect of the current situation is that we can work entirely online. Make sure you can deliver a service online so you can scale up quickly when needed. Are you doing this right? Then you can really make 2021 your year. Indeed, due to the massive and prolonged closure of physical stores, we saw that shoppers are moving to the online channel. This trend will continue tirelessly in 2021. So every entrepreneur needs a digital skillset this year.

This trend also applies: you should keep following your customers and actually always be just one step ahead. See if you can offer your products and/or services on online marketplaces such as bol.com. But platforms that focus on a special consumer or product group are particularly interesting this year.

For example, do you produce high-quality, natural foods? Then you can make a deal with AH, but you can also look at the Crisp platform. Another good example is the personal trainers who started developing online platforms and videos so that their clients could continue to exercise at home.

In short: stay inquisitive, innovative and make sure the basis of your company is tight.

#### Trend 2: Alternative Financing

Alternative forms of finance have experienced rapid growth in recent years, a trend that will skyrocket even more in 2021. They have become increasingly relevant for the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises.

There are various reasons why entrepreneurs sometimes need extra support: growing, investing, expanding, competing and seizing opportunities. Are you going to the bank to apply for financing? Then keep in mind that there are many considerations for them to reject your application, especially now.

That's why we see many companies moving to alternative financing. This way, they can not only survive, but even invest to make growth possible this year.

#### Trend 3: working from home is becoming common

Where many companies were previously reluctant to work from home, we showed during the crisis that this works great. In fact, labour production has increased! Technology like Zoom and Google Hangouts makes it easy to consult with each other.

People seem to like working from home. Only the personal aspect is now missed, so we will see a hybrid construction emerge in 2021: partly from home, partly from the office. For you, this means that less office space is needed and office costs will fall. See where you can cut provisions and save money every month.

#### Trend 4: work data-driven

The digital layer that lies over the physical world provides a wealth of data. You can use this data to optimize your business in such a way that you serve your customers even better. And that's key in 2021. Ask questions like “how do I collect data?” , “what can I do with my data?” and “how do I analyse the data?” part of your business strategy.

It's a good idea to work with other companies. For example, when we look at innovations in the hospitality industry where hospitality entrepreneurs and producers work together, we see that they combine their knowledge very nicely. For example, the “Support Your Locals” platform has been created where individuals can order their products online. How can you make your knowledge and expertise more widely available?

#### Tip 5: Bet on home security

With continuing to work from home, the need for security is also becoming higher than it ever was. After all, home networks are often far less secure than those in offices.

In 2021, information security will therefore become a normal part of our lives. After all, internet criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and do not often even look at what kind of company they are dealing with. Use a password vault, set up 2-step identification, update your systems, and segment your network. These are things you can do on your own relatively easily, but it pays to be advised. This way, you minimize the risk that your entire company will ever be shut down due to troublesome ransomware.
