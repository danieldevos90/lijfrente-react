Feel free to contact us! We’re here for you every working day!

We only provide to companies that are registered with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK) in the Netherlands with a business bank account. In addition, you must be economically active for at least one year and have a turnover of at least €50,000 in the past year.

Swishfund is a recognized SME financier that has been supporting entrepreneurs in the Netherlands since 2016 with fast and accessible business financing, combining the efficiency of fintech technology with personalized service.

We look at this per situation. We think it is important that you can afford the loan. Swishfund provides loans ranging from €3,000 to €500,000. We can calculate your credit space without obligation and free of charge.

Once your application is completed and reviewed positively, we will deposit the money into your business account within 24 hours.

During the application, you can specify the desired amount, the term and purpose of the loan. In addition, we always ask you to upload a transaction summary of your business bank account in the MT940 file format. You can easily download such an overview from your bank's online environment. After we have calculated your credit space, we will contact you for the next steps. Depending on the size of the request, we need a number of additional documents.

The cost of your loan consists of a one-off closing fee and a monthly interest. The amount of these costs is percentage and therefore depends on the loan amount. The standard closing fee is 2% with a minimum amount of €650. The monthly interest is determined based on your company's risk profile. You will receive a final proposal after reviewing your application. To give you a clear picture of the costs for business loans, we have drawn up two examples, showing the possible costs in a so-called UKO (Uniform Credit Overview). See examples here.

If you are in default, we may take a number of measures to ensure that the money is reimbursed.

If we extend the term of your loan, we will do so for another period of the same or different duration (that choice is ours). You must pay us two amounts for the extension:

- You have to pay a new premium. We will let you know the amount of the new premium before the extension takes place.
- You must pay an extension fee. The extension fee is 5% of the outstanding loan amount, unless we agree otherwise with you.

We will then process the extended term, the new premium and the extension fee into an adjusted final payment schedule, send it to you and continue collecting on that basis.

Yes, definitely. If you do not have an ATM, we will provide a direct debit.

Yes, you can. You can always repay all or part of the loan earlier than at the end of the term. We do not charge a penalty, but you still have to pay the agreed interest. If you repay the loan completely earlier, we will give you an interest discount. The sooner you repay the loan in full, the higher the premium discount is.

According to the Golden Balance Sheet Rule, the maturity of the assets on the balance sheet must be very similar to the maturity of the assets on the same balance sheet. Roughly speaking, this means that fixed assets — assets held for more than one year — must be financed with long-term capital (= equity, provisions and long-term debt). The current assets, held for less than one year, can be financed with short-term debt.

The spending goal is the destination of your loan. In other words, what are you going to use the loan for? For example, pre-financing an order or purchasing inventory.

We can call on a guarantor if you fail to meet the payment agreement. We always ask you to vouch for the loan you take out yourself, or to have another (affiliated) person guarantee.

We may ask you to provide “securities”. This is also known as collateral. By pledging your securities, we get the right to collect them if you are unable to meet the payment obligation.

A **lien** is a legal right or claim granted to a lender (creditor) over a debtor's property or assets, which serves as security for a debt. If the debtor fails to meet their payment obligations or defaults on a loan, the lien allows the creditor to take specific actions to recover the debt, such as selling the pledged property or asset.

We only provide to companies that are registered with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK) in the Netherlands with a business bank account. In addition, you must be economically active for at least one year and have a turnover of at least €50,000 in the past year.

You can only use the loan to finance your business activities.

Where banks have partly stopped financing small and medium-sized businesses, Swishfund continues. By using smart technology, we are able to simplify the complexity of traditional corporate finance.

Our loans range from 3 months to 24 months. You can specify the desired duration yourself during the application.

The application itself takes 5 minutes. After a working day, we will contact you by email or phone to discuss the first results. Based on this, we request some additional information and strive to have the money in the account within a week.

We collect the repayment and premium on a daily basis by means of a direct debit. Of course, we take into account (your company and) fluctuations in turnover, such as seasonal patterns.

In addition, there is the option to pay daily by skimming a percentage via your card machine. By the way, this is only possible if you have a CCV device. The great thing about this is that you pay extra on days with a high turnover.

If you are in default, we may take measures. There are a number of reasons why you can get into delinquency. The main reason is that a collection fails and there is a backlog or that you do not fulfill another contractual obligation with us in time or in full. In that case, we will first give you notice of default. You will then have 10 days to pay the arrears before we may claim the loan. In other cases of default, we may claim the entire loan immediately without warning. This is the case when the following occurs:

- You have financial debts or have given securities to third parties that are not or are not correct in your application.
- A security that you had to provide for us is not valid or ends; or someone who provided us with security for your loan does not fulfill their obligations to us in a timely or complete manner.
- You have provided us with information that is inaccurate or incomplete.
- You are not fulfilling an obligation to a third party in respect of a financial debt, such as for credit, rental, or otherwise.

If we claim the entire loan earlier, you must immediately repay us the entire loan and pay any other amounts that we are entitled to under your agreement with us.

- You owe us penalty interest on any amount you pay us late, for the period from the date you were due to pay until the day you pay. The penalty interest is the same as the statutory commercial interest rate.
- Upon first request, you must reimburse us for all costs we incur in connection with or under the applicable claim ground. Contrary to the
*Cash Income Expenses Act*, the extrajudicial collection costs are 15% of the total amount due. - We can make use of all the securities. In that case, you may not ask the preliminary relief judge for a different way of selling.
- We may ask you for extra guarantees. You must then ensure that those securities are established immediately.

It is essential for us that our collections to your bank account go smoothly. You are therefore not allowed to close or change your bank account, nor make changes to your collection authorization, unless we have indicated by letter or email that we agree.

If a collection fails, you are in default and we may do anything the law allows us to do and/or one or more of the following:

- Reclaim as many times as necessary to make up for the failed collection.
- Adjust the frequency of collections
- Incorporate the failed collection into your final payment schedule. We will continue collecting based on the adjusted final payment schedule.
- Extend the term of your loan.

The provisional payment schedule is included in the contract (loan agreement) and is an indication on a monthly basis.

Yes, definitely. If you do not have an ATM, we will provide a direct debit.
