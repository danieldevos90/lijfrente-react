## Cappuccino koffieplein

It's a household name in Hilversum: Cappuccino Coffee Square in the Hilvertshof shopping center. This coffee and sandwich shop has been located on the first floor of the recently renovated shopping center since 1973. Gamal Ramadan has been at the helm since 2003.

### The challenge

Gamal faced the challenge of rebuilding his Cappuccino hospitality business after a major renovation of the mall, which involved moving to a new location. This not only meant the risk that regular customers would no longer find him, but also that he would have to completely redesign his business with new equipment, an exhaust system and furniture, while he had no initial capital. Thanks to rapid financing through Swishfund, he was able to overcome these challenges, renew his business and increase his turnover. This not only allowed him to stabilize his business, but also to realize new dreams, such as opening a smoothie bar.

“Fifteen years ago, I had the opportunity to take over the business. The old owner thought it was time to hand over the baton and I was interested in it. Cappuccino has been a well-known place in Hilversum for many years. Regular and new guests always know where to find us,” says Gamal, who thinks the strength of Cappuccino lies in the specially roasted coffee beans.

The entire shopping center underwent a major renovation from 2015 to 2017. “We had a bad time. We had to move to a new place. Guests will then no longer know where to find you. But luckily, the renovation is now complete, we're about back to our old place and we've built a wonderful new business with a very nice view.”

As a result of the renovation, the new business was completed as a result of the hull. Gamal had to start from scratch: including a new extraction system that had to meet the latest requirements and completely new furniture. “I got rid of a lot of furniture from the old store. With a new location, you just need new stuff. You're not going to cut back on small things,” says Gamal.

But those new items cost money and Gamal did not have any starting capital. That's why he called in Swishfund. “Within four business days, the money was in my account. It was so fast. That was really the reason for me to knock on the door. The way of working is very pleasant. There is personal attention and I can always contact them with my questions.”

Reimbursement is easy. Every day, a pro rata amount has been collected. “The advantage of this is that you can finish paying off within six months. It's so easy because you don't have to think about anything anymore.”

The extra credit has already brought a lot to Gamal. The new equipment and more extensive menu have increased sales enormously. That good experience got the enthusiastic entrepreneur thinking about fulfilling a long-desired dream: a smoothie bar! “You have to move with the times. People want to eat healthy and natural products. There will be a whole new counter, with coolers so that we can keep the products fresh. In addition, there will be professional mixers.” The renovation will start soon, thanks to Swishfund's newly granted loan.
