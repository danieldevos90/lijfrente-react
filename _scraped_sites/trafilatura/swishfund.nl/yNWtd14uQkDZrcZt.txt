#### Merel Nijland

## Introduction

Many entrepreneurs are busy bridging increasing payment terms or pre-financing projects or stocks. The low season is also no unknown factor. You usually cover this period of low income with income from the high season. But suppose you have to deal with larger expenses than usual during the off-season. If you unexpectedly have to make a big expense, you'll run into trouble. How are you going to deal with this? However, the bills must continue to be paid. Then a business bridging loan comes in handy.

### What is a bridging business loan?

A bridging loan is a business loan and is intended to cover a short period of time. It is also sometimes called a “supplementary” **working capital**“called”. Basically, financing additional working capital is equivalent to bridging financing.

#### What can you use it for?

There are many reasons for taking out a business bridging loan as an entrepreneur. Think about things like:

- Purchase new equipment for projects;
- Purchase more inventory;
- Achieving a purchasing advantage;
- Temporarily absorb less income;
- A debtor who is waiting;
- Unexpected loss of income;
- Investments in your business that benefit you in the high season.

During COVID-19, many applications were made for a bridging loan. Entrepreneurs saw this as an alternative to the support packages. Even after the crisis, it can be a good option if you are going to make large investments.
