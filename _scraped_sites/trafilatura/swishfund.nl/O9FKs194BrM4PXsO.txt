# Stopping Corona support packages: what now?

#### Merel Nijland

## Introduction

A year and a half and 80 billion euros later, the corona support packages will end in October. On August 30, Wopke Hoekstra (Minister of Finance) announced this permanently. Economists say now is a good time, but entrepreneurs fear the consequences. What are the expectations now that support stops?

**Why are the corona support packages not being extended?**

For a few months, there has been talk about stopping the corona support packages, because the economy is recovering. The expected economic growth in 2021 is substantial at around 4%. This is enough reason for the cabinet not to renew the support packages after 1 October.

The letter to parliament for the fourth quarter states that the CPB has already warned about continuing with the support packages. This would have a negative effect on the economy's recovery. This negative effect is partly due to the large staff shortage.

As long as the support packages remain, it would prevent people from moving to places where they are desperately needed. In addition, the dynamic of starting companies and companies that quit has been significantly disrupted. There must be more space for starting and innovative entrepreneurs. According to ministers, this healthy dynamic will only return when support stops.

**No major wave of bankruptcy expected**

Many entrepreneurs are afraid that stopping support is too early and that they will run into financial problems. Economists say, on the contrary, that the support should not have lasted much longer. If we look at the CPB's expectations, they foresee **not a big wave of bankruptcy**** **when the support packages disappear, precisely because the economy is growing again.

The bankruptcies that will fall are the companies that will be kept alive by the support. These are most likely the companies that would not have survived in a normal situation either. Extra support is being considered for clubs and discotheques. What this means exactly is not yet clear. They will probably have to remain closed after 1 October.

**Over the next 6 months, investments will be made in growth**

We expect an increase when it comes to growth investments. But at the moment, entrepreneurs need to take stock first. All advances, subsidies and support must be reimbursed. You can read how it works with refunding **here**. Even if you have received a tax deferral, you are expected to pay tax again as of October 1, 2021.

Despite everything that has to be paid back, economic growth of 3% is expected in 2022, which means that companies are growing and also investing in their own growth. Due to the shortage in the labor market, investments will also be made in staff and recruiting them.

**A financial boost for your company**

Okay, so a lot is going to happen in the near future. The corona support packages will not be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fortunately, there are still additional compensations and/or arrangements for various sectors, but the government is not yet clear what this means.

We all agree that the economy is recovering. Economists are confident that things will continue to go well even without the corona support packages.
